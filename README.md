## Installation

Avatari works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'avatari'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install avatari

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'avatari', github: 'jonhue/avatari'
```

Now run the generator:

    $ rails g avatari

Add the stylesheet to the asset pipeline:

```
/*
 *= require avatari
 */
```

## Usage

### CarrierWave

To backup CarrierWave add an `avatar` column (`string`) to every ActiveRecord model's database table you are using Avatari on.

The `avatar` attribute can be used like any other CarrierWave instance.

Avatari makes some assumptions about your CarrierWave integration. For Avatari to work properly after installation, [Fog](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave#fog) and [MiniMagick](https://github.com/minimagick/minimagick) have to be set up. However they can be unrequired when [configuring](#configuration) Avatari.

Avatari preprocesses uploaded avatars by default:

* `raw` (800x800)
* `big` (350x350)
* `medium` (100x100)
* `small` (75x75)
* `tiny` (50x50)
* `mini` (40x40)

### Models

You can add Avatari to an ActiveRecord model:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
    avatari
end
```

You can also pass an `initials` option, which specifies an attribute or instance method that returns initials used for placeholder avatars if no custom avatar has been uploaded yet:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
    avatari :initials

    def initials
        [self.first_name, self.last_name].join(' ')
    end
end
```

By default Avatari manipulates the passed initials: only the first characters of the first two word will be used as initials:

```
'Jonas H端botter'
=> 'JH'
'jonas h端botter'
=> 'JH'
'jonas h端botter and someone else'
=> 'JH'
```

**Note:** When [rendering](#views) an avatar and you did not provide the `initials` option + no avatar has been uploaded yet, the helper method will return `false`.

To add custom background colors to your placeholder avatars, pass the `colors` option:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
    avatari colors: ['#000000', '#333333']
end
```

For every instance of the class, Avatari will pick a sample of the array of provided background colors. The default for every instance is `#000000`.

To attach a picked color to a given record permanently, you will also have to add an `avatar_color` string column to your database tables.

There is a variety of other options you can pass to further configure Avatari. Here are the defaults:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
    avatari colors: ['#000000'], versions: {
        mini: [40,40],
        tiny: [50,50],
        small: [75,75],
        medium: [100,100],
        big: [350,350],
        raw: [800,800]
    }, default_version: nil, process: [800,800], extension_whitelist: ['jpg','jpeg','png']
end
```

### Views

To render an avatar in your view, utilize the `avatari` helper method:

```haml
= component 'avatari/avatar', object: current_user
```

You can also specify a size:

```haml
= component 'avatari/avatar', object: current_user, version: :tiny
```

You are able to check whether or not an avatar can be rendered:

```haml
- if avatari? current_user
    = component 'avatari/avatar', object: current_user
```

## Configuration

You can configure Avatari by passing a block to `configure`. This can be done in `config/initializers/avatari.rb`:

```ruby
Avatari.configure do |config|
    config.default_version = :medium
end
```

**`default_version`** Default version to be used when rendering avatars. Takes a symbol. Defaults to `:medium`.

**`mini_magick`** Whether or not to include MiniMagick. Required for processing file versions. Takes a boolean. Defaults to `true`.

**`storage`** Choose you default storage option for CarrierWave. Accepts `:file` or `:fog`. Defaults to `:fog`.
