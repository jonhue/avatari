## Installation

Avatari works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'avatari'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install avatari

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'avatari', github: 'jonhue/avatari'
```

## Usage

### Assets

To render Avatari avatars, you have to require the necessary assets to be added to your asset pipeline:

```js
//= require avitari
```

```css
/*
 *= require avitari.min
 */
```

**Note:** You can override the [styles](vendor/assets/stylesheets/avatari.sass) when you are looking for a custom integration.

### CarrierWave

To backup CarrierWave add an `avatar` column (`string`) to every ActiveRecord model's database table you are using Avatari on.

The `avatar` attribute can be used like any other CarrierWave instance.

Avatari makes some assumptions about your CarrierWave integration. For Avatari to work properly, [Fog](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave#fog) and [MiniMagick](https://github.com/minimagick/minimagick) have to be set up.

Avatari preprocesses uploaded avatars:

* `raw` (800x800)
* `big` (350x350)
* `medium` (100x100)
* `small` (75x75)
* `tiny` (50x50)
* `mini` (40x40)

It accepts images in `jpg`, `jpeg` and `png` format.

### Models

You can add Avatari to an ActiveRecord model:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
    avatari
end
```

You can also pass an `initials` option, which specifies an attribute or instance method that returns initials used for placeholder avatars if no custom avatar has been uploaded yet:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
    avatari :initials

    def initials
        self.first_name[0] + self.last_name[0]
    end
end
```

**Note:** When [rendering](#views) an avatar and you did not provide the `initials` option + no avatar has been uploaded yet, the helper method will return `false`.

To add custom background colors to your placeholder avatars, pass the `colors` option:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
    avatari colors: ['#000000', '#333333']
end
```

For every instance of the class, Avatari will pick a sample of the array of provided background colors. The default for every instance is `#000000`.

To attach a picked color to a given record permanently, you will also have to add an `avatar_color` string column to your database tables.

### Views

To render an avatar in your view, utilize the `avatari` helper method:

```haml
= avatari current_user
```

You can also specify a size:

```haml
= avatari current_user, :tiny
```

The `size` of the rendered avatar defaults to `:medium`.
